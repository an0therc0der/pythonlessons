What a lesson! This lesson took a deeper look at lists and how you might
actually use them in programs. There really is a lot to know when it comes
to lists, but hopefully you have a general understanding of them at this
point. This repository has all of the example code as well as the exercise
solution. Take a look and see if everything makes sense to you!
