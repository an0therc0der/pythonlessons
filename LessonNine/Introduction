This lesson covered writing your own functions! We discussed how you can write functions
that require no input (no arguments) and how you can write functions that require input
(require arguments) in order to efficiently reuse code. Functions really do help us reduce 
the amount of code needed in a program and give us quite a bit of flexibility in applying
common steps throughout the program. Take a look at the examples in this repository.
